### Build your own Pokedex
In this midcourse project, you'll need to build a pokedex like the one we show in the image below. For that, youÂ´ll need to create from scratch the HTML that will shape each one of the Pokemon cards, style them accordingly and create the necessary scripts to iterate over your stored pokemons and display them on screen. With this project, you're going to have the chance to put into practice all that you've learnt so far.

### Bonus points
- Try to make that hover effect when the cursor is pointing each one of the cards. Remember that the pseudo selector needed for this is :hover
- If you feel creative, try to reproduce the same animation you see on the Gif from above. Even though there are multiple ways of doing this, a good option is to use the CSS selector @keyframes.
